House Prices Prediction Model

Overview

This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of rooms. It leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression models to provide accurate price estimations.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw housing data for better model performance.

Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features to improve prediction accuracy.

Machine Learning Models: Implements multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest.

Performance Evaluation: Uses metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score to assess model accuracy.

User-Friendly: Well-documented and structured for easy replication and improvements.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
